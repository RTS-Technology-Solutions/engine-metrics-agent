- [X] What's the approximate data volume (GB)? Unknown, TBD after initial upload
- [X] What file formats are used? PGN, JSON, MD
- [X] How often is new data generated? Daily/weekly

### 🎯 Priority Use Cases
- [X] Which questions are most valuable to you?
    1. "How has V7P3R improved version over version?"
    2. "What caused the version X performance drop?"
    3. "Which engine performs best in blitz?"
    4. "What are the key factors influencing engine performance?"
    5. "What are the heuristical differences between engines?"
    6. "How do different time controls affect engine performance?"
- [X] What decisions do you need AI help with?
    1. Identifying performance trends to plan new heuristic implementations
    2. Diagnosing performance issues to prioritize bug fixes
    3. Comparing engines to inform development focus areas
- [X] Any specific analysis workflows to maintain?
    1. Engine tournaments executed via Arena GUI will always produce PGN files to be processed
        1a. PGN files will also be generated via engine-tester battles and gauntlets
    2. Puzzle Analysis and puzzle ELO estimate JSON results will be produced from the engine-tester tool
    3. Custom scripts will generate JSON/MD reports for deeper analysis
    4. Primary competitive landscape is V7P3R (human built/managed engine) vs SlowMate (Copilot built/managed engine) vs C0BR4 (C# human/AI hybrid "control" engine)

### 💼 Business Requirements
- [X] Monthly budget preference? <$20/month to start - personal use only>
- [X] Timeline for completion? 1-2 weeks
- [X] Any security/compliance needs? general IP protection for the project and data security - standard Firebase security rules should suffice
- [X] Who will be the primary users? Myself (Pat)
